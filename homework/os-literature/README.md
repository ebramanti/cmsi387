### Article 1: Limitations of Dijkstra's Semaphore Primitives and Petri nets

This article is connected to the original work because it studies the limitations of Dijkstra's semaphore primitives that he postulates about in his original work in 1965. They expand upon Dijkstra's original work by finding areas that have been improved upon and discussing the work of multiple researchers who are studying Dijkstra's work.

This article approaches the original work in an entirely different way. While Dijkstra's original method was to use P and V primitives, they are considered to be indivisible in this work. Kosaraju studies a better approach through a work by Patil and his discovery, which he calls "CSP," or the "Cigarette Smoker's Problem." Patil suggests a generalization of the P primitive as a better method. Patil's work is even expanded upon, with Parnas' work to further the study of Patil's "Cigarette Smoker's Problem," showing that using an array of semaphores brings this issue Patil discovered back. Parnas solves this problem by making arrays of semaphores that are finite and bounded.

I believe that this article is well-written for a few reasons. It demonstrates an attention to multiple research projects regarding Dijkstra's original paper, and compiles them in a way to effectively show the limitations of his work. Kosaraju, the original writer of this piece, recognizes solutions people have come up for the limitations of cooperating sequential processes. The ACM Digital Library has published this work as well, which leads me to believe it is trustworthy research on Dijkstra's original problem.
